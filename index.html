            <h2>Mikael Åkerfeldt</h2>
            <br>
            <p>He is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of progressive metal band Opeth. 
                A former vocalist of death metal supergroup Bloodbath, he was also guitarist for the "one-off" 
                band Steel, and part of the collaboration Storm Corrosion with Steven Wilson.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A native of Stockholm, Mikael Åkerfeldt was the vocalist for Eruption, a death metal band that he formed in 
                    1987 at 13 years old.[5] After Eruption came to an end in 1989, he joined Opeth, ostensibly as a keyboardist. 
                    When their original bassist left Opeth two years later, Åkerfeldt replaced him as bassist; Isberg then assumed 
                    guitar duties. When Isberg left Opeth three years later, Åkerfeldt replaced him as the vocalist.</p>
